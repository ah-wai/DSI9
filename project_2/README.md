### Ames Housing Data (Kaggle Challenge)
### Predict the price of a house and providing business insights to improve sale prices

## Problem Statement:
Housing prices are generally affected by several key factors. Using a regression model, we will found out what are these key factors (some surprising, some not) and build a model that is able to predict the housing prices.
​
## Objective:
    1. Build a regression model to predict the housing prices
    2. Understand what are the key contributors of this prediction
​
## Methodology:
Using the Ames Housing Data, we will build a regression model to predict housing prices and also extract it's components to explain the prediction
​
## Constrains:
The dataset does not take into account amenities, infrastructure and crime rates which will impact the sale price. <br>
Other factors to consider will be the listing price, what was given was only the transacted price.
​
## Materials:
### 1. Codes
There are 7 notebooks trying out 7 different approaches are modelling. <br>
Do look at [model 4](https://github.com/ah-wai/DSI9/blob/master/project_2/codes/Project%202%20-%20Model%204.ipynb) only if you are short of time.
### 2. Datasets - all csv files related to project
7x final.csv files for Kaggle submission<br>
sample_sub_reg.csv, a sample on how the submission file will look like<br>
train.csv, training data for the model<br>
test.csv, test data for submission
​
## Recommendation & Conclusion:
Apart from the model which could predict the housing prices, some recommendations for: <br>
Buyers: <br>

    1. Get a newly built house<br>
    2. Maximise property space<br>
    3. Reside in Stone Brook or Northridge Heights <br>
Sellers: <br>

     1. Perform maintenance work to reach at least "average" rating<br>
     2. Improve the finishing of your residence<br>
