# Project-1
### SAT test vs ACT test (2017/2018)
### Analyse the popularity of both tests and recommend on how to improve uptake for SAT
​
## Problem Statement:
SAT and ACT tests are common high school test that students in the US take as an entry to college.
Popularity for each test is dependent on state laws and policies, as well as the schools the students wish to enter.
​
As such, we analysing from SAT's prespective, wish to understand the situation on the ground and come up with potential recommendations on where to invest and grow SAT's business in the coming year.
​
## Objective:
    1. Understand the background "fight" of the two tests.
    2. Recommendations on where to invest and grow SAT's business in the coming year 
​
## Methodology:
Using ACT and SAT dataset for 2017 and 2018 aggregated across 51 states, we will visualise the data on a US map to see how the popularity differs year on year.
​
## Constrains:
The dataset is restricted to only aggregated data per state, hence we are only comparing averages across different states in terms of popularity and scores. More granular data is required to make better recommendations
​
## Materials:
### 1.Code - starter-code.ipynb
    The main source code where all the analyse happens.
### 2. Data - all csv files related to project are included
    Contains individual SAT and ACT by year (2017, 2018), a combined SAT/ACT by year (2017,2018) and final dataset
​
## Recommendation & Conclusion:
The key considerations in recommending the states will be:
    1. State Laws
    2. Participation Rates
    3. Budget

Final recommendation: Alaska will be the state to invest to get more students in the next year for SAT
